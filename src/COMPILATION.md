# AMS_5600_PI

Compilation seemed heavily platform dependent when I was
testing this; you may need to fiddle with this. However,
if you get it to compile it should work without a problem.

On RPI I used:
`$: g++ AMS_5600.cpp main.cpp -o main`

Where main.cpp is the application that uses the encoder.
See the examples.
